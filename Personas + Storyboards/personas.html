            <p>He leaves school at 5 pm and takes the bus home. He has a snack before doing his homework, then uses the
                Play the Web application in his spare time to learn basic skills and improve his scores in the
                challenges. He then goes to dinner with his parents at around 7.30 pm.
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>He logs on to the application, starts by completing one or two new lessons, and then goes on to complete
                the corresponding challenges to check that he has understood. Then he plays other challenges to improve

                <li>She is dyslexic so she has a lot of trouble learning her written lessons. Similarly, for her
                    practical work and projects, she can't read the documentation as easily as others, and can't do
                    research on internet forums.</li>

                    documentation.</li>
                <li>To learn her lessons, she has to ask someone to record herself reading them so she can listen to

                lessons, works on her projects, and finally goes to bed.
            </p>

            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>She uses the app to review concepts she has seen in class, or to help herself with projects. She quickly
                skips the lessons and concentrates on the challenges, because they're interactive, so she can
                concentrate better.</p>

                <li>The young graduates he recruits to his team often need "refresher" training on the basics, because

            <p>He leaves home around 8am, starts his day with meetings from 9 am to 11 am, then joins his team. He often
                acts as a trainer for new recruits in the early afternoon, then returns to work until 6:30 pm. When he
