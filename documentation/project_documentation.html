                                        <li>Swipe Left-Right: for the pages that have the “left arrow” icon in the right-up corner, there is the swipe left-right option to change the screen to the previous page</li>

                <p>The application is built such that it is easy to understand without having lots of previous experience in working with such an app. However, in case there is still need for explanation, the user may go on the “Settings” page and click on “help”.

                </h3>
                <p>The application opens on the “Home” page. From here, the user has multiple possible ways to follow.
                    <ol>
                        <li>The app opens on the “Home” page. The user can always come back to this page by clicking on the “home” icon on the bottom bar (for the mobile app) or the “home” box on the navigation bar (for the desktop version) Here, there are presented the different concepts that may be tested, along with the percentage of progress that has already been made. By clicking on the “triangle” icon beside a concept, the user is redirected to the page where they can play and learn.</li>
                        <li>On the right-up corner, there is the “settings” icon that redirects the user to the “Settings” page. Here, they can change the language, time zone and the light/ dark theme. The user can also log out by clicking on the “Log out” button. There are also given information about the legal terms, policy and open-source libraries.</li>
                        <li>If the user is not yet logged in, they are redirected to the “Sign in/ up” page, where they can login, if they already have an account, or can register by creating a new account.</li>
                        <li>The last section of the “Settings” page is the line “Need help?”. Here, by clicking on the word “help”, the user is redirected to a new page. The user can get information about a certain topic by clicking on the button labelled that way.</li>
                        <li>The “Profile” page, that can be accessed by clicking the “profile” icon on the bottom bar or the “profile” box on the navigation bar, displays the current “Total progression” made by the user. Here, by clicking on the button labelled “Statistics”, the user is redirected to a page that displays a chart of time spent using this app. The user can choose if the time displayed refers to this week only or to the whole month.</li>
                        <li>Back on the “Profile” page, by clicking on the button labelled “Account info”, the user is redirected to a page displaying their personal info: username, email, phone number and profile picture. Each of these fields have a “pen” icon attached that, by clicking, allows the user to modify the information. On the bottom of the page, there is a button labelled “Reset password” that redirects the user to a new page.</li>
                        <li>The “Reset Password” page requires a verification code for security purposes and states the question whether the code should be sent via email or phone; the user chooses one of the two by clicking on the either on the “envelope” icon, meaning message, or the “G” icon. After the code has been introduced, the user has to click on the “Validate” button and, if the code is correct, they are redirected to a “New Password” page. Here, they need to type in the new password, confirm it by typing it again and then press either the “Save” button, or the “Cancel” button in case they changed their mind.</li>
                        <li>The page “Forum” can be accessed clicking on the “chat boxes” icon or the “Forum” box. This page presents a list of discussion topics and, by clicking on any of them, the user is redirected to the conversation taking place on that topic. On this new page, the user can read all the replies given by other users and can also reply in their own comment. The icon in the left-up corner, the “left arrow”, takes the user back to the “Forum” page.</li>
                        <li>Still on the “Forum” page, there is a button labelled “Create Subject” that redirects the user to a new page. Here, they need to type in a title for the new discussion they want to start, select one of the given categories and write their full-length question. Then, they may cancel the conversation by clicking on the “Cancel” button or can proceed and post the discussion by pressing the “Submit” icon.</li>
